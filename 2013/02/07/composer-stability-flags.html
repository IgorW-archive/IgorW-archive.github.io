        <h1>Composer Stability Flags</h1>

<p>The most common issue coming up in composer support at the moment is confusion
about how stability is determined.</p>

<p>Usually it is a variant of this case:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I require package A:dev-master, which depends on B:dev-master, composer
tells me that package B was not found.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Root package</h2>

<p>The root package is the main <code>composer.json</code> file. It is the one in the same
directory that you run <code>composer install</code> in. Many of the fields in
<code>composer.json</code> are <em>root-only</em>, which means that they only have an effect if
they are specified in the root package.</p>

<p>The root package is a context. Let&#39;s say you are depending on a package <em>A</em>.
In the directory of your own package, your package is the root package. If you
<code>cd</code> into the directory of <em>A</em>, then <em>A</em> is the root package.</p>

<p>Stability is determined by the root package, and the root package only. Let
that sink in for a moment, and don&#39;t ever forget it.</p>

<p>Composer puts the decision of how stable your dependencies are in the hands of
the user. As a user, you decide if you want to use dev, beta or stable
releases.</p>

<h2>minimum-stability</h2>

<p>The basis of this decision is the <em>minimum-stability</em> field in the root
package. It&#39;s a <em>root-only</em> field. It defines a default value for stability
flags and acts as a lower bound.</p>

<p><center>
    <img src="/img/composer/minimum-stability.png" alt="minimum-stability">
</center></p>

<p>It&#39;s a ruler that you can pull down. By default only shows &quot;stable&quot;, but you
can pull down and reveal the lower stability flags.</p>

<p><em>minimum-stability</em> defines the default stability flag for all constraints.</p>

<h2>Stability resolution</h2>

<p>So let&#39;s think of a scenario where the root package requires package <em>A:dev-
master</em>, which in turn requires <em>B:dev-master</em>.</p>

<p><center>
    <img src="/img/composer/scenario-1.png" alt="scenario-1">
</center></p>

<p>The root package looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;require&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;A&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;dev-master&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Composer will follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Determine <code>minimum-stability</code>: In this case the field is not defined, so it
is set to the default value, which is &quot;stable&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>It sees that <em>A</em> has a constraint for version <code>dev-master</code>. Due to the
<code>dev-</code> prefix, this is known to be a dev version, and dev versions have
&quot;dev&quot; stability. Because this constraint for a dev version is defined in
the root package, it implicitly gets the <code>@dev</code> stability flag.</p></li>
<li><p>Since <em>A</em> has a constraint of <code>A:dev-master@dev</code>, this version matches and
composer follows the link. It sees that <em>A</em> has a dependency on <em>B</em> with a
constraint of <code>dev-master</code>. This has a <code>dev-</code> prefix, so it has a stability
of &quot;dev&quot;.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However, since the constraint is defined in package <em>A</em> and not the root
  package, it does not implicitly get the <code>@dev</code> stability flag. Instead it
  inherits the <code>minimum-stability</code> which is &quot;stable&quot;. So the resolved
  constraint is <code>B:dev-master@stable</code>.</p>

<p>At this point it will fail, because <code>B:dev-master@stable</code> does not resolve to
anything. It will tell you that it cannot find a package <em>B</em> within the
stability range you provided.</p>

<p>One way to fix the problem would be to just lower your <code>minimum-stability</code>
down to &quot;dev&quot;. But that&#39;s usually a really bad idea, because it applies to all
constraints and as a result you will get unstable versions of <em>all</em> packages.</p>

<p>So please, don&#39;t do that.</p>

<h2>Stability flags</h2>

<p>Instead, use stability flags.</p>

<p>A flag is defined as part of a version constraint. Since stability is
determined by the root package only, flags are also <em>root-only</em>. Flags defined
in dependent packages are simply ignored.</p>

<p>You can use flags to whitelist specific unstable packages. In this case I want
to whitelist <em>B</em>. Here is how you do that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;require&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;A&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;dev-master&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;B&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;@dev&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that I did not define an actual version in the root package. This means
that the root package does not care which version of <em>B</em> is installed, it
delegates that decision to <em>A</em>, which has a more specific constraint.</p>

<p>The benefit is that if <em>A</em> decides to change its dependency on <em>B</em> from
<code>dev-master</code> to <code>~1.0</code> or anything else, the root package will not need any
changes.</p>

<h2>Silex example</h2>

<p>To get a better idea of how this works in practice, let&#39;s look at an example
involving silex.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing there is no stable version of silex, which means
in order to install it, you need to add a <code>@dev</code> flag:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;require&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;silex/silex&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1.0.*@dev&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Silex only has a <code>1.0.x-dev</code> version, which is the dev version of the <code>1.0</code>
branch.</p>

<p>All of the dependencies of silex have stable releases. Which means by default
you will get <code>v2.1.7</code> of a number of symfony components and <code>v1.0.1</code> of
pimple.</p>

<p>If you wanted to try the <code>v2.2.0-RC1</code> version of those symfony components that
was released a few days ago, you could whitelist them like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;require&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;silex/silex&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1.0.*@dev&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;symfony/event-dispatcher&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;@RC&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;symfony/http-foundation&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;@RC&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;symfony/http-kernel&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;@RC&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;symfony/routing&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;@RC&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Since specifying all of those versions is kind of tedious, you could lower the
<code>minimum-stability</code>. In this case that is okay, because it is not installing
unstable packages that you do not want.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;minimum-stability&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;RC&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;require&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;silex/silex&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1.0.*@dev&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>prefer-stable</h2>

<p>Some time after this post was written, composer got a new <code>prefer-stable</code>
feature.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to figure out the stability of your deps, you can just use
the <a href="http://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#prefer-stable"><code>prefer-stable</code></a>
field in your root package. Composer will try to figure out the most stable
deps it can.</p>

<p>This is quite convenient and often will get you something good enough. But I
would still encourage you to think more about which stability you really want,
and declaring it explicitly. You may be trading convenience for control.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully this gives you a better understanding of how composer determines
stability and how you can use stability flags to get those unstable versions.</p>

<p>Remember though: Most likely the reason why you need those stability flags is
because the maintainers of your dependencies did not tag stable releases. You
should go and annoy them <em>right now</em> so they add branch-aliases and tag
releases. And as soon as they do, you can nuke those stability flags and be
happy again.</p>
