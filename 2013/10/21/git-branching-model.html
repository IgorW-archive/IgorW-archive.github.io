        <h1>Git Branching Model</h1>

<p>Since the original <a href="http://nvie.com/git-model/">A successful Git branching model</a>
post from <a href="https://twitter.com/nvie">nvie</a> there have been numerous attempts to
simplify his model. While it is a very solid branching strategy, you do end up
with a ton of branches that you may not actually need.</p>

<p>This post aims to document the general strategy that has been in use by a
subset of the PHP community (and likely other communities too), and thus also
plays nice with <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a> and composer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: This model is intended for OSS projects. For products, I would
recommend something <a href="https://gist.github.com/jbenet/ee6c9ac48068889b0912">like
this</a>.</p>

<h2>Versions</h2>

<p>As defined by semantic versioning, versions are in the format
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.</p>

<p><center>
    <img src="/img/git-branching/version.png" alt="version">
</center></p>

<h2>Branches</h2>

<p>You generally have one branch per minor version. This means branches like:
<code>1.0</code>, <code>1.1</code>, <code>1.2</code>, <code>2.0</code>, <code>2.1</code>, <code>2.2</code>, etc. The &quot;latest&quot; version is
represented by the <code>master</code> branch. This is just a common convention.</p>

<p>But &quot;latest&quot; can mean one of two things. Either it is the development of a yet
unreleased version. Such as <code>1.1-dev</code> which will eventually become <code>v1.1.0</code>.
Or alternatively there could already be a release on <code>1.1</code>, and this would be
the development of the <em>next</em> release, such as <code>v1.1.1</code>.</p>

<h2>Tags</h2>

<p>Releases are identified by tags. A tag represents a patch version and points
to a commit on the branch of that minor version. The <code>v1.0.0</code> tag points to a
commit on the <code>1.0</code> branch.</p>

<p>Unlike nvie&#39;s model, this one does not have a dedicated branch for releases,
since the releases can be inferred from the tags.</p>

<h2>Bugfixes</h2>

<p>In many cases there will be more than one branch active at the same time.
Bugfixes should generally target the latest supported branch. For example, if
the <code>1.0</code> branch is no longer being maintained, but <code>1.1</code> and <code>1.2</code> are
active, then a bugfix should be applied to <code>1.1</code>.</p>

<p>Because <code>1.2</code> is a downstream branch of <code>1.1</code> it will get those bugfixes as
well. Just periodically merge <code>1.1</code> into <code>1.2</code> and all will be fine.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>According to semantic versioning, new features should result in a new minor
version. If the latest release is <code>v1.0.5</code>, then there should be a <code>master</code>
branch representing <code>1.1</code>. New features should be merged into <code>master</code>. Once
<code>v1.1.0</code> is released, <code>1.1</code> should be branched off of <code>master</code>, and <code>master</code>
should become <code>1.2</code>.</p>

<p>For smaller projects this rule can be relaxed and new features can be merged
into a branch that already has releases. But keep in mind that it makes it
harder for users to track which version introduced a particular feature.</p>

<h2>Topic branches</h2>

<p>A workflow for contributions is usually based on topic branches. Instead of
committing to the particular version branch directly, a separate branch is
made for a particular feature or bugfix where that change can be developed in
isolation. When ready, that topic branch is then merged into the version
branch.</p>

<p><center>
    <img src="/img/git-branching/topic.png" alt="topic">
</center></p>

<p>If a change spans more than one commit then this allows keeping track of what
was merged when, and also allows it to be reverted in one go if needed.</p>

<p>More importantly, it allows new features to be prototyped independently
without making a commitment to those changes.</p>

<p>Topic branches are usually very short-lived and are discarded after being
merged.</p>

<h2>That&#39;s it</h2>

<p>This post really just documents the process that many of us have been using
for our projects. If you have anything to add, please share it in the
