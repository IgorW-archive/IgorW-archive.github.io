        <h1>Autoload path depth insanity</h1>

<p>In the recent 2-3 years there have been a few major developments in the PHP
community. I&#39;d say the most notable ones were the creation of the PSR-0
autoloading standard and the dawn of the composer dependency manager.</p>

<p>The PSR proposals were originally based on the common ground between the
projects pushing them. Today they dominate the way modern PHP libraries are
written. I think it&#39;s time to stop and think for a minute about how we really
want our code and libraries to look like.</p>

<h2>Update (2014-01-04)</h2>

<p>The situation has improved. We now have a
<a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md">PSR-4 specification</a>
and support for this new standard
<a href="http://seld.be/notes/psr-4-autoloading-support-in-composer">in composer</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who made this happen.</p>

<h2>Autoloading</h2>

<p>While I believe that the creation of
<a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md">PSR-0</a>
was extremely important for PHP, I no longer care about autoloading. The reason
is simple: Composer made it irrelevant.</p>

<p>With composer you get autoloading for free, but even better: you now have a
standard tool that can generate a classmap instantly. Classmap is one of the
most performant ways to lazy-load classes and it does not even care which
files they are in.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">src
└── Symfony
    └── Component
        └── HttpKernel
            └── HttpKernelInterface.php

library
└── Zend
    └── Mvc
        └── Application.php
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you take a look at these two examples, they have something in common. Both
of them contain a useless level of directory nesting. Both Symfony&#39;s <code>src</code> and
Zend Framework&#39;s <code>library</code> directory contain only one single directory -- as
such it could be eliminated.</p>

<p>Of course PSR-0 would allow removing the <code>src</code> directory and having <code>Symfony</code>
in the root directly (and some projects do that) but that&#39;s not ideal, as you
lose the ability of having a consistent directory for the source code.</p>

<h2>Who will win the pointless nesting competition?</h2>

<p>Here is an example from a library I wrote, called Ilias:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ilias
├── src
│   └── Igorw
│       └── Ilias
│           └── Program.php
└── tests
    └── Igorw
        └── Tests
            └── Ilias
                └── ProgramTest.php
</code></pre></div>
<p>Unlike the previously mentioned projects, this library is not part of a big
organization. As you can see, there are not one, but <em>two</em> levels of
unnecessary directory nesting. The name of my project is <code>igorw/ilias</code>, why
would I care to repeat this information <em>yet again</em> in the directory
structure?</p>

<p>And it gets even worse when look at the unit tests. The amount of nesting is
reaching a level of ridiculousness that exceeds the amount of ignorance a
human being can generate. I hate to say it, but this is annoying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Side note: Fortunately PHPUnit does not care about autoloading, so I can
shorten the test filename to <code>tests/unit/ProgramTest.php</code>, which also allows
for a clean separation between unit, integration and functional tests.

</blockquote>

<p>But instead of just complaining, I have a few suggestions that would greatly
improve the way we deal with autoloading today, by introducing a sane amount
of brevity.</p>

<p>It would allow the path to be shortened to <code>src/Program.php</code>.</p>

<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>Based on <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md">PSR-0</a>,
these are the changes I would make:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An autoloader must take a <code>class_prefix</code> option which defaults to <code>null</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>If the <code>class_prefix</code> is not <code>null</code> and the <abbr title="Fully-qualified
class name">FQCN</abbr> begins with the <code>class_prefix</code>, the <em>transformed
class prefix</em> must be stripped from the beginning filesystem path.</p></li>
<li><p>The <em>transformed class prefix</em> is calculated by applying the following
transformations to it:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the last character is not a namespace separator, append one.</li>
<li>Convert each namespace separator to a <code>DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">class_prefix: Symfony
class name:   Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpKernelInterface
filename:             Component/HttpKernel/HttpKernelInterface.php

class_prefix: Zend
class name:   Zend\Mvc\Application
filename:          Mvc/Application.php

class_prefix: Igorw\Ilias
class name:   Igorw\Ilias\Program
filename:                 Program.php
</code></pre></div>
<p>The composer configuration could be something along these lines, the class
prefix can be used both matching and for constructing the directory prefix:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;autoload&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;psr-n&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nt">&quot;Igorw\\Ilias&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;src&quot;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Based on the feedback I receive I may write up a more detailed spec and a
proof-of-concept implementation for submission to the PHP
<a href="http://www.php-fig.org/">FIG</a>.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Why not just use classmap?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The main annoyance with classmap autoloading is that you must manually re-
  dump it every time a new class is added, which makes it unsuited for a
  development environment.</p>

<p>Sure, you could hack together an autoloader that re-generates the class map
  if a class is not found, but I would strongly favour a clean solution over
  such hacks.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Doesn&#39;t composer&#39;s <code>target-dir</code> fix this?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, no. The <code>target-dir</code> is prepended to the entire package name,
  which means you will need to put code in your top level directory.</p>

<p>What I am asking for is <code>src/{$prefix}/Name.php</code>, which is not possible with
  <code>target-dir</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>But Symfony2 bundles do not have nesting and work fine.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>See the composer <code>target-dir</code> question above.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Just use an IDE, it will solve all your problems!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>An IDE cannot fix the filesystem structure of a software project.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What if the FIG does not like it?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the feedback I receive, I may consider submitting a patch for
  composer anyway.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&lt;insert random insult here&gt;</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks man, I appreciate it.</p>
