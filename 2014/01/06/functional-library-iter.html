        <h1>Functional Library: Iteration</h1>

<p>Welcome to the functional library. This series will explore the state of
functional programming in PHP and highlight some libraries for common tasks.</p>

<p>This post will look at iteration and lazy operations based on a sequential
abstraction.</p>

<h2>Sequence</h2>

<p>Yes, you heard right. Sequential abstraction. That&#39;s a fancy shmancy word for
something we already have in PHP called <code>Iterator</code>. An iterator is really just
an object that represents a <strong>stream</strong> of values.</p>

<p>As a consumer of an iterator this really just means one thing. You can
<strong>foreach</strong> over it, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">foreach ($users as $user) {</span>
<span class="x">    echo $user[&#39;name&#39;].&quot;\n&quot;;</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But there&#39;s a few other properties of iterators that are quite interesting.
One in particular is <strong>laziness</strong>.</p>

<p>Laziness means that the iterator is able to fetch data on demand, which allows
you to process that data as it arrives (reducing latency) and only keep a bit
of it in memory at a time (reducing overall memory consumption).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: Of course there are trade-offs and lazy-everything isn&#39;t always the
best solution. For example, disk seeks tend to take some time. So batching
reads in large enough chunks is still important for overall performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now. One problem is that once you use <code>foreach</code>, it will start consuming the
iterator on the spot. And thus you instantly lose the laziness. It is possible
to retain it though, and I will show you how.</p>

<h2>Map</h2>

<p>By using functional primitives that operate on sequences, you can describe
high-level transformations on sequences.</p>

<p>How often have you written this piece of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">$names = [];</span>
<span class="x">foreach ($users as $user) {</span>
<span class="x">    $names[] = $user[&#39;name&#39;];</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Have you ever thought to yourself <em>there must be a better way</em>?</p>

<p>There is a better way.<sup><a id="ft-1-src"></a><a
href="#ft-1">1</a></sup></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">use function iter\map, iter\fn\index;</span>

<span class="x">$names = map(index(&#39;name&#39;), $users);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>All of the boilerplate is gone. It is now just one single line that describes
the transformation.</p>

<p>It gets better. The laziness is no longer broken. <code>map</code> does not take an array
of values, it takes an <em>iterable</em> of values. And it returns, you guessed it,
an <em>iterable</em> of mapped values.</p>

<p>How does it do that? We&#39;ll get there. But first, let&#39;s define what <code>map</code>
actually is.</p>

<p><strong>map</strong> is a function that takes a function and a sequence. It returns a new
sequence where the function has been called on every element of the input
sequence.</p>

<p><center>
    <img src="/img/funlib-iter/map.png" alt="map">
</center></p>

<p>Because you are forced to pass in a function, the resulting code will be more
modular. It&#39;s less convenient to nest things, like it was with <code>foreach</code>, and
I&#39;d argue that that is actually a good thing.</p>

<p>Another advantage is that <code>map</code> deals with values and returns you a new value
that is much safer than modifying existing arrays in a loop.</p>

<h2>Filter</h2>

<p>It turns out that <code>map</code> is just one of many high-level iteration functions. I will show you a few more.</p>

<p>How often have you written this piece of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">$admins = [];</span>
<span class="x">foreach ($users as $user) {</span>
<span class="x">    if (is_admin($user)) {</span>
<span class="x">        $admins[] = $user;</span>
<span class="x">    }</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Have you ever thought to yourself <em>there must be a better way</em>?</p>

<p>There is a better way.<sup><a id="ft-2-src"></a><a
href="#ft-2">2</a></sup></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">use function iter\filter;</span>

<span class="x">$admins = filter(&#39;project\user\is_admin&#39;, $users);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>All of the boilerplate is gone. It is now just one single line that describes
the filtering.</p>

<p><strong>filter</strong> is a function that takes a predicate and a sequence. It returns a
new sequence that only contains the elements for which the predicate returned
true.</p>

<p><center>
    <img src="/img/funlib-iter/filter.png" alt="filter">
</center></p>

<p>Now remember every time you wrote a loop that did both filtering and mapping
in the body. Since there are now two separate functions for those, you can
separate those responsibilities. First filter, then map.</p>

<p>It gets better: Because both <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> are lazy, the result of
chaining them will also be lazy. This allows you to compose lazy workflows
that only get processed on demand.</p>

<h2>Any</h2>

<p>How often have you written this piece of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">$admins_present = false;</span>
<span class="x">foreach ($users as $user) {</span>
<span class="x">    if (is_admin($user)) {</span>
<span class="x">        $admins_present = true;</span>
<span class="x">        break;</span>
<span class="x">    }</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Have you ever thought to yourself <em>there must be a better way</em>?</p>

<p>There is a better way.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="x">use function iter\any;</span>

<span class="x">$admins_present = any(&#39;acme\is_admin&#39;, $users);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>All of the boilerplate is gone. It is now just one single line that describes
the search.</p>

<p><strong>any</strong> is a function that takes a predicate and a sequence. It returns true
as soon as the predicate returns true. It returns false if the end of the
sequence is reached without finding a match.</p>

<p><center>
    <img src="/img/funlib-iter/any.png" alt="any">
</center></p>

<p>What did I tell you about laziness. Since <code>any</code> aborts as soon as it finds a
match, the rest of the sequence is not processed. This means that any calls
affecting the remaining elements do not need to be executed.</p>

<h2>nikic/iter</h2>

<p>All of the examples above are based on <a href="https://twitter.com/nikita_ppv">Nikita
Popov</a>&#39;s most excellent
<a href="https://github.com/nikic/iter">iter</a> library.</p>

<p>It makes heavy use of a new feature introduced in PHP 5.5 by Nikita himself:
Generators. Generators are the magic sauce that make everything lazy. You can
think of them as a sane way of writing iterators by suspending execution.</p>

<p>The <strong>iter</strong> library is awesome. It has <em>lots</em> of these iteration-related
functions that are very common in functional languages. I&#39;ll list a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>map</li>
<li>filter</li>
<li>reduce</li>
<li>zip</li>
<li>slice</li>
<li>take</li>
<li>drop</li>
<li>repeat</li>
<li>keys</li>
<li>values</li>
<li>any</li>
<li>all</li>
<li>flatten</li>
</ul>
